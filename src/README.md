  This project uses Java for the logic contained within the program, some of the other key technologies behind  this program are-  SQL  for  the database system, and JDBC to allow Java to access data within that database. 
   
    
### Takeaways

 This is the first project that I have designed that connects to and uses a database. A lot of a new syntax for me that I became more familiar with as I worked through the program. I enjoyed combining different elements within this project, using things like an interface and lists to create new objects was a fun challenge for me.
